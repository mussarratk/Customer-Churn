- pipeline -
- Model development
  - - framework choice - the ability of framework to scale with project demands
  - - Model lifecycle
- deployment platform - AKS (Containerized application)- ACI - on cloud scalability: autoscaling, secure your model and integrate with other systems(DB, API, WServices), performance: speed - Powerful Solution
  - - Azure service - would you use to deploy an ML model as a web service that can be accessed by other applications via HTTP requests
- Maintain: App Insights and Monitor (Data Drift) - Continuous monitoring helps ensure the model remains accurate and effective, allowing for timely adjustments if performance issues arise.

  * AutoML - automatically select and tunes best performing model

  - Data access - API, Webscraping, DB, sensor, IoT git, link, external, open source
  
      *  RAG enables AI to retrieve fresh (real-time), relevant data from external sources, enhancing the generated contentâ€™s accuracy and relevance.
      *  https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-ai-and-machine-learning/supplement/AMEqp/comparison-of-data-sources-for-rag-and-traditional-ml-pipelines

 - The main purpose of data encryption is to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access, ensuring privacy and security.RBAC is a widely used method for managing user access to sensitive data based on their roles within the organization.
 - Data Management
  - - Data quality -To improve the accuracy and reliability of the AI models
   -- Data governance ensures responsible usage of data, compliance with regulations, and overall data quality throughout its life cycle.

- ML framework
  * Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, Apache Spark MLlib, Azure ML SDK
  * Define - Model Type : deep learning task - tensflow/pytorch - large scale - GPU/TPU - cloud - edge
            -- classical ml algorithm - DT, SVM - small/medium - CPU - sk-learn
    
- Azure
